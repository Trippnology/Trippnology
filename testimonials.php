						<p>Having discussed what we needed and wanted as a company, Rikki provided us with a detailed spec sheet of what would be completed. We have not looked back since. He delivered on time, to budget and provides support on a level that every staff member can understand. His personable nature and excellent understanding in his area of expertise makes problem solving and one-off jobs a pleasure to undertake, with his constructive and positive direction.</p>
						<p>A big thank you for all you have done so far, from Avant UK.</p>

						<p>I have used Trippnology to design several websites and have been very satisfied with their delivery. They work with me to ensure design and site structure is what I, or my clients, want; and deliver the service swiftly and flexibly when things or minds get changed in the middle of a web-build.</p>
						<p>Their ongoing support is also timely and good value. Highly recommended.</p>

						<p>I designed our own website using an off the shelf package and managed to wipe out my business email trying to publish it. I turned to Rikki in my panic and he fixed and reorganised everything calmly and quickly.</p>
						<p>Rikki pointed out our website was difficult for customers to find. He re-wrote it for SEO and improved the design. The amount of new enquiries tripled immediately. Our new website has increased sales and portrays a professional image of The Limecrete Company Ltd.</p>

						<p>My wife and I were illiterate as far as computers are concerned. Rikki has helped us choose equipment, has installed it and shows us how to use it. He quickly answers all of our silly queries with great patience.</p>
						<p>Without his help we would be quite lost. He is invaluable.</p>
